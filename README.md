# FTP (x-FTP)

This is the FTP website, where it shows everything that has been posted to the GitHub (except this project, due to paradox.) This is the last repository on this account, we will go by LDT soon.

The assets can be found: [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

**(Thanks Ritwick, for the FTP HTML!)**

## FAQ

**Now for the last official time, my favourite, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Yeah, sure! That is why we make repositories like these public, for you tinker and try new things while learning.

#### Can I host this? If I can how?

You can! With my favourite Apache Container, XAMPP. since this is the last (official) repository here is a quick summary: 

So, Apache uses 127.0.0.1 which leads back every Windows and Linux, (and some configured macOS) machines, back to itself to host websites, and XAMPP gives it a GUI (Graphical Interface)

Here is a [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to it. And if you are struggling with it here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff); and for the novices here is a tutorial on how to self-host a domain: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Souy).

## Documentation

- This project doesn't really have any good documentation, just a normal understanding of HTML and CSS to understand, (knowing JavaScript is optional, but would be a upperhand).

- But here is the link to the extension, I took the template from [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) by Ritwick Dey (on Visual Studio Code Marketplace).


## API Reference

There are no APIs known of, this project only consists of Vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript, and images. No frameworks, if there is, I will update this readMe.
